# LoRa Sensor Arduino Project Setup

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to configure your Arduino environment to use custom board definitions necessary for the LoRa Sensor project, particularly for the `Alphatronique LoRa Sensor (SAMD21)` board, which is compatible with the Adafruit Feather M0.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
- Access to the GitHub repository where the project is hosted.

## Custom Board Definitions

The project uses specific hardware definitions that are not included in the standard Arduino IDE. These definitions are crucial for compiling the transmitter sketch correctly.

### Steps to Install Custom Hardware Definitions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Start by cloning the LoRa_Sensor repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Git installed or download the ZIP file directly from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoRa_Sensor.git
    ```

2. **Locate the Hardware Definitions:**
   Navigate to the `transmitter/Sensor_firmware` directory within the cloned repository. Here, you will find a folder named `hardware` containing the board definitions for `Alphatronique LoRa Sensor (SAMD21)`.

3. **Copy the Hardware Folder:**
   You need to copy this `hardware` folder into your Arduino directory where additional board definitions are stored.

    ### For Windows:
    Copy the `hardware` folder to the following location:

    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\Arduino\hardware
    ```

    If the `hardware` folder does not exist, create it.

    ### For macOS and Linux:
    Copy the `hardware` folder to:

    ```plaintext
    ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware
    ```

    If the `hardware` folder does not exist, create it.

4. **Restart Arduino IDE:**
   Close and reopen your Arduino IDE after copying the files. This will prompt the IDE to reload all available board definitions.

5. **Select the Custom Board:**
   Go to `Tools > Board` in the Arduino IDE, and you should now see `Alphatronique LoRa Sensor (SAMD21)` listed under the custom boards. Select this board for compiling the transmitter sketch.

## Compiling and Uploading the Sketch

Once the board definitions are set up, open the transmitter sketch from the `LoRa_Sensor` project and verify/update any necessary configurations specific to your setup. Compile and upload the sketch to your Alphatronique LoRa Sensor board.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Arduino IDE not recognizing the custom board, ensure the `hardware` folder is correctly placed and contains all required files. Sometimes, a second restart of the Arduino IDE or a reinstallation of the Arduino IDE might be necessary.
